# Boxee Advanced
Boxee was a cross-platform media center, but is no longer being developed. The PC version of Boxee can still be downloaded from various sites. This remote controls Boxee using the Boxee web API. This works well when Boxee isn't running on the same computer as Unified Remote, and also works with the Boxee Box.
