# Screen
This remote lets you view your computer display from your phone (like Remote Desktop / VNC). You can also move the cursor and click on the screen to interact with programs. This is very useful for when you're not in the same room as your computer.

## Platforms
* Windows
* Mac OSX

## Todo
This is still an early version, so some advanced features are lacking, such as:

* Pinch to zoom
* Dragging and right-click
* Multiple monitors
