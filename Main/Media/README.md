# Media
A generic system media remote control. The remote simulates media keys, so this remote will work with any application that listens to the standard media keys. In most cases it is easier to use a remote specific for the application you wish to control, but if you can't find a remote for that application then you could try this remote instead.

## Features
*  Volume (up, down, mute)
*  Next & previous track
*  Stop playback
*  Toggle playback (play, pause)
